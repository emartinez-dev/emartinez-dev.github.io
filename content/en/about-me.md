I'm Enrique Martínez, a software engineer currently working at
[GTD](https://www.gtd.eu/en), where I contribute to cutting-edge aerospace
projects. Let me share a bit about my journey.

After earning a degree in Business Management and Administration, I worked for
three years in Digital Marketing and SEO. During that time, I discovered my
passion for programming by creating automation tools to streamline repetitive
tasks. I developed Slack bots, web scrapers, and Google Sheets automations,
which sparked my interest in problem-solving and software development.

In 2022, I took a leap and joined [42 Málaga](https://www.42malaga.com/), an
innovative coding school with a peer-to-peer learning methodology. Immersing
myself in this environment, I mastered foundational programming concepts like
Git, Unix systems, and C, while also learning the importance of collaboration
and self-driven learning.

By mid-2023, I transitioned into software development professionally, and today,
I focus on building reliable, impactful software in the aerospace industry. Over
the past year, I've deepened my skills in Python, Vue.js, and other
technologies, while constantly learning and contributing to meaningful projects.

This blog is where I share my thoughts, personal projects, and anything else I
find inspiring along the way. If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free

Thanks for stopping by—I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
